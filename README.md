# 🐦 Flappy Bird – Unity Clone

A simple clone of the classic **Flappy Bird** game made using **Unity and C#**.  
This is my third time building it (shoutout to laptop crashes 💀), but I managed to rebuild the core functionality in **one day**!

## 🎮 Features
- Bird flapping mechanics using Rigidbody2D
- Pipe spawning system with random heights
- Score counter that increases as bird passes pipes
- Game over screen and restart button

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Unity 2021
- C#
- YouTube (yes, we learn like that out here 😤)

## 📁 Project Structure
- `Assets/`: Game scripts, sprites, scenes
- `ProjectSettings/`: Unity settings and inputs
- `Packages/`: Unity dependencies
